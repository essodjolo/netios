  Description
  -----------

  Netios is a little tool aimed to help network administrators to administrate a large number of Cisco network devices.
  Providing it with a list of equipments, it connects within SSH to remotly apply IOS commands.

  It can automatically :
    - retrieve and export in a CSV file the list of local users
    - update the local user, the enable password
    - change NTP settings
    - execute a file of customed IOS commands

  It can read the targets from the command line or from a text file.


  License
  -------
  Netios is distributed under GNU license. See COPYING for more details.

  For commercial usage please contact: jc@phocean.com
       
           
  Requirements
  ------------

  - A Python compiler (tested with python 2.6) with basic modules

  - Python modules : pexpect, datetime, getpass


  Supported platforms
  -------------------

  The tool has been succesefully compiled and tested under the following platforms:

    Linux 2.6.x
    
    But it should work on any platform with python support : FreeBSD, Solaris, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Windows, MacOS


  Platforms on which it is able to operate
  ----------------------------------------

  Netios was developped to administrate Cisco routers and switches. It has been tester on about 200 routers, switches and wireless access-points, with various IOS versions.
  It still requires more testing, but it is supposed to work on any platform with an SSH access configured.

  For now, it is aimed to work only with Cisco and there is no warranty about what could happen with another SSH platform.


  How to install
  ---------------

    tar xvfz netios-{release}.tar.gz
    cd netios-{release}
    python setup.py install


  How to use:
  -----------

  See manual for details or use the -h command line to list available options.


  Architecture
  ------------

  The Netios components are :
   - a run script, netios, as the user interface
   - a ssh class, based on pexpect for taking care of the ssh connection
   - a cisco class, inherited from the ssh class, adding cisco attributes like specific commands, workarounds, etc.
